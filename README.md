# Creating an interactive calculator in Scala

Create a small application in Scala that acts like a simple calculator.\
The aim is to enable a user to perform basic mathematical calculations and obtain the result immediately.

### Main objective:

To develop an interactive calculator where the user can enter a mathematical operation in the form of two numbers and an operator (for example: 5 + 3), and obtain the result displayed on the screen.

<hr>

Project steps :

<ol>
<li><strong>User input :</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>The user types in a mathematical expression in a simple format (e.g. 5 + 3).</li>
<li>The program needs to retrieve this input.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Data processing:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Cut out the input to extract the two numbers and the operator.</li>
<li>Perform the corresponding calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division).</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Display results:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Once the calculation has been performed, display the result clearly to the user.
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<hr>

Going further (optional) :

<ul>
<li><strong>Error handling:</strong> If the user types an incorrect operation (for example: text, an invalid operator, or division by zero), display an appropriate error message.</li>
<li><strong>Loop mode:</strong> Allows the user to perform several successive calculations. The program ends only if the user types `exit`.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

Expected deliverables :
<p>A functional Scala program capable of :</p>
<ul>
<li>Read a mathematical expression in number operator number format.</li>
<li>Perform the operation and display the result.</li>
<li>Handle incorrect input and errors elegantly.</li>
</ul>
This project will enable you to practice user input management, conditional structures (`match`) and the basics of the Scala language, while creating a concrete and useful application!
